# Pulsar Auth

Pulsar Auth is a React-based front-end application that serves as the authentication and user interface component for the PulsarAI project. It provides a seamless user experience for interacting with the GraphQL API and WebSocket server implemented in the backend.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Pulsar Auth incorporates user authentication functionality, allowing users to sign up, log in, and manage their accounts securely.
- **GraphQL Integration**: The application integrates with the GraphQL API provided by the PulsarAI backend, enabling seamless data fetching and mutations.
- **Real-time Communication**: With the help of the WebSocket server, Pulsar Auth facilitates real-time communication between the client and the server, enabling real-time updates and notifications.
- **Modern UI**: The user interface is built using Ant Design, a popular React UI library, ensuring a modern and responsive design.
